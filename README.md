# Dice-App
Dice Application created in Xcode software for ios development, I used Swift programming language. 

How it works?
To roll the dice simply tap on the "Roll" button to roll both dices, also if you have a physical iphone device, 
I have implemented a motion dector feature that when you shake your device, you should see the dices change to another number.
